# SimpleGraph

A very basic graph gem for Ruby.

Currently only unweighted, undirected graphs are supported.
This means that multiple edges between nodes are ignored, although self loops are allowed.

#### Warning
Note that this is a very early version, and everything about this library is subject to change at any given time without notice. Expect breaking changes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_graph'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_graph

## Documentation

Docs are built using YARD and are available at https://vesther.github.io/simple_graph/

## Usage

### Quickstart
```ruby
require "simple_graph"

# Creating a new, empty graph
graph = SimpleGraph::Graph.new

# Adding nodes to the graph
# Creates a empty node containing only a autogenerated identifier
# Returns a graph-unique identifier for the newly created node
foo = graph.add_node()
# IDs can also be set manually
graph.add_node(id: "Kevin")
# Graphs can also hold arbitrary information in the 'data' hash
stuff = {
  age: 21,
  depression: true
}
bar = graph.add_node(id: "Igor", data: stuff)

# Edges can be created by passing the two node IDs to the connect_nodes method
graph.connect_nodes(foo, "Kevin")

# Paths between two nodes can be found by breadth-first search
# This method will return a array of arrays containing node IDs describing the path
paths = graph.find_paths(foo, bar)

# Retrieving info about the graph
graph.node_count # Returns the amount of nodes in the graph
graph.node_ids # Array of node identifiers in the graph

# Graphs can be written to files in the DOT format to be used with Graphviz
# Note that the node ID will be used for labels
File.write("test.dot", graph.to_dot_string)
```
